- [x] Write function, that adds two lists (**mergeLists()**)

- [x] Write function, that adds two queues (**mergeQueues()**) 

- [x] Write function, that swaps first and last element(queue) (**Queues::swapFirstWithLast()**)

- [x] Write function, that swaps first and last element(list) (**Lists::swapFirstWithLast()**)

- [x] Write function, that swaps given element with its successor (**swapGivenXWithSuccessor()**)

- [ ] Write function, that deletes every second element 

- [x] Write function, that deletes n of elements, after given x (**deleteNElementsAfterX()**)

- [ ] Write function, that sorts list

- [x] Write function, that inverts the list
 
- [x] Write functon, that inserts element after given x (**addAfterGivenX()**)

- [x] Write functon, that inserts element before given x (**addBeforeGivenX()**)

- [x] Write function, that copies in pattern below: (**copyEqualToValue()**)


    
  
head | -> | 2 | -> | 4 | -> | NULL
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---|--- 

head | -> | 2 | -> | 2 | -> | 4 | -> | 4 | ->| 4 | -> | 4 | -> | NULL
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 




##ToDo:

- [ ] All unfulfilled project statements(*list above*)

- [ ] Review of existing code

- [x] Queues destructor

- [ ] getHeadAndTailVal()
