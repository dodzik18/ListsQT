#My own implementation of linked list, and queue

- [x] Write function, that adds two lists (**mergeLists()**)

- [x] Write function, that adds two queues (**mergeQueues()**)

- [x] Write function, that swaps first and last element(queue) (**Queues::swapFirstWithLast()**)

- [x] Write function, that swaps first and last element(list) (**Lists::swapFirstWithLast()**)

- [x] Write function, that swaps given element with its successor (**swapGivenXWithSuccessor()**)

- [ ] Write function, that deletes every second element

- [x] Write function, that deletes n of elements, after given x (**deleteNElementsAfterX()**)

- [ ] Write function, that bubblesorts list

- [ ] Write function, that inverts the list

- [x] Write functon, that inserts element after given x (**addAfterGivenX()**)

- [x] Write functon, that inserts element before given x (**addBeforeGivenX()**)

- [x] Write function, that copies in pattern below: (**copyEqualToValue()**)
